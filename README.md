Data Cleansing is defined as the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record, set, table, or database. Data cleansing can also be referred to as data cleaning, data scrubbing, or data reconciliation.
In this project, I took a restaurant data cleaned the data, removed outliers and replaced the missing values.
